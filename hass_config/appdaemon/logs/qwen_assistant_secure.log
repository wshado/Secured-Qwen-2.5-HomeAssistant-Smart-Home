[2025-08-21T13:31:34.978378] Qwen Response (validated): It seems there was a mix-up in the initial message provided. Let me clarify with correct details:

Your smart home system has the following current status:
- The temperature is set to 76.1 degrees.
- The humidity level is at 53%.
- There are no motion sensors active, so it&amp;#x27;s currently off and not triggering any alerts or actions.
- LED activation count stands at 95.0 times.
- There are no motors or lights in operation.

Is there anything specific you need help with regarding this setup?
